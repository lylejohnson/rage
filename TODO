Ideas
=====

 * Behaviors as mixins
 * Web interface for agent management
 * Web-based message viewer
 * Federated search for directory facilitator
 * Support for RDF or OWL content language
 * Helpers for constructing message content
   - Does the FIPA-OWL ontology include stuff like agent registrations, service descriptions, etc.?
 * Mobility
   - Using ruby2ruby?

Bugs
====

 * AMS should maintain agent state, not the agent itself

Kinds of Agents
===============

 * News feed monitor (RSS/Atom)
 * E-mail monitor (POP)
 * Front-end to web service
 * Text messaging agent
 * Instant Messaging (IM)
 * Twitter

Unfinished Business
===================

 * SLCodec (slcodec.rb) and related grammar (slparser.y) for SL message content
